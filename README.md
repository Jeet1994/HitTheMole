HitTheMole
==========


This a simple game where there is a 10X10 matrix of radio buttons,

Each radio button becomes ON after a certain time period.

Our aim is to hit the radio button as soon as its ON.

For each correct hit you get a +1 and for each wrong hit you get a -2.

I have loaded the code with lots of comments. Plaese ping me for any queries.
